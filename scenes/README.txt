This folder contains all 4 scenes that appeared in the UPBP paper: 
- bathroom:     created by Chaos Group (http://www.chaosgroup.com), 
                modified by Iliyan Georgiev and Martin Sik
- candle:       originally from the bathroom scene,
                modified by Jaroslav Krivanek
- mirror balls: created by Toshiya Hachisuka (http://cs.au.dk/~toshiya/), 
                modified by Martin Sik
- still life:   created by Ondrej Karlik (http://keymaster.cz/), 
                modified by Martin Sik, environment map Newport Loft by Blochi
                taken from http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive/

Each scene is defined by three files (please see the Petr VÃ©voda's thesis 
for more information about them):

OBJ
A file with geometry of the scene in the Wavefront OBJ file format. Can
be obtained via export from 3ds max or other 3D modelling software. 

MTL
A file with materials of the scene geometry in the MTL file format. Can
be obtained via export from 3ds max or other 3D modelling software
(while exporting to OBJ).

AUX
A file with definition of the camera, media, additional material
properties and lights. It is a manually created ASCII file in our own format.

Besides the .OBJ, .MTL and .OBJ.AUX files you will find a folder called batches
for each scene. It contains batch files that were used to render images in
the UPBP paper. You can directly run them or use as a guide for rendering these 
scenes with suitable command line arguments.
