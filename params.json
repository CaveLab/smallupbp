{"name":"SmallUPBP","tagline":"A (not too) small physically based volumetric renderer","body":"###  Introduction\r\n\r\nSmallUPBP is a small physically based renderer that implements the unifying\r\npoints, beams and paths algorithm described in the paper\r\n\r\n>  **[Unifying points, beams, and paths in volumetric light transport simulation](http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~jaroslav/papers/2014-upbp/index.htm)**  \r\n>  Jaroslav Křivánek, Iliyan Georgiev, Toshiya Hachisuka, Petr Vévoda, Martin Šik,\r\n>  Derek Nowrouzezahrai, and Wojciech Jarosz  \r\n>  ACM Transactions on Graphics 33(4) (SIGGRAPH 2014)  \r\n>  [BibTeX] (2014-upbp.bib)  \r\n>  ![teaser](http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~jaroslav/papers/2014-upbp/teaser/reference.jpg)\r\n\r\nas well as a number of other algorithms, notably including progressive photon\r\nmapping, (progressive) bidirectional photon mapping, bidirectional path\r\ntracing, vertex connection and merging, beam radiance estimate, and photon \r\nbeams.\r\n\r\nThe code compiles to a command line program that can render images of a\r\nnumber of predefined scenes using the provided algorithms as well as of\r\ncustom scenes supplied by a user.\r\n\r\nIt is based on [SmallVCM renderer](http://www.smallvcm.com) developed in 2012 \r\nby Tomas Davidovic (@tomas-davidovic) and Iliyan Georgiev\r\n(@iliyang). SmallUPBP heavily modifies it to add support for\r\nparticipating media, beam-based volumetric estimators and user scenes. Its\r\nmain authors are Petr Vevoda, Martin Sik (http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~sik/)\r\nand Jaroslav Krivanek (http://cgg.mff.cuni.cz/~jaroslav/).\r\n\r\nA third-party code is incorporated. Namely [Embree](http://embree.github.io/)\r\nfor ray tracing acceleration and [OpenEXR](http://www.openexr.com/) for reading\r\nand writing OpenEXR images.\r\n\r\nSmallUPBP is released under the following license:\r\n* [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) - most of the supplied code, scenes and associated files\r\n* [Apache 2.0 license](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) - Embree\r\n* [modified BSD licence](http://www.openexr.com/license.html) - OpenEXR\r\n\r\nThis code was used to render the images in the aforementioned paper and all scenes\r\nand batch files necessary for reproducing the presented results are provided. \r\nIt is released for educational and research purposes and neither the code nor\r\nits documentation claims to be complete and bug-free. We apologize for any errors\r\nand confusion.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or ideas for improvement, feel free to contact Jaroslav\r\nKrivanek (<jaroslav.krivanek@mff.cuni.cz>), the primary maintainer of this project.\r\n\r\n### Contents\r\n\r\nThe archive you have downloaded should contain following folders and files:\r\n* embree-2.0 - source code of Embree\r\n* OpenEXR    - header files and precompiled libraries of OpenEXR\r\n* scenes     - scene and batch files used to render images in the UPBP paper\r\n* SmallUPBP  - source code of this renderer\r\n* Tools      - a few scripts for results display and comparison\r\n* README.txt - this text\r\n\r\n### Compilation and run\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to compile SmallUPBP is to use the provided Visual Studio 2013\r\nsolution `SmallUPBP\\SmallUPBP.sln` (should work in Visual Studio 2010 or later). \r\nSimply build it and you will recieve `SmallUPBP.exe` in `Build\\SmallUPBP\\x64\\Release`\r\n(or `Build\\SmallUPBP\\x64\\Debug` dependig on what configuration you have selected). \r\nThis file is completely independent on the others, you can move it and run \r\nwherever you want (however, batch files in the `scenes` folder expect it here).\r\n\r\nTo give you insight: the solution contains three projects - _embree_, _sys_ and\r\n_SmallUPBP_. The first two are parts of Embree and need to be compiled as static\r\nlibraries and linked along with `OpenEXR\\OpenEXR.lib` with the main project _SmallUPBP_.\r\nWe recommend to compile with C++11 support, but the program will work anyway, \r\nalthough a worse random number generator will be used.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, the resulting executable file is a command line program.\r\nType `SmallUPBP.exe -h` or `SmallUPBP.exe -hf` to see a short and full help respectively.\r\nThe short help contains only basic arguments sufficient to render your first images\r\nwhile the full version lists all arguments the program knows.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
